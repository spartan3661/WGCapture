# wgcapture

> Consistent, window-based screen captures on Windows using WinRT + Windows Graphics Capture (WGC).

A small library that makes it easy to capture screenshots of *Windows (application windows)* rather than whole monitors. This helps produce consistent, high-fidelity captures across multiple displays, scaling/DPI settings, and systems where monitor-based grabs are unreliable.

> **Note:** This package targets **Microsoft Windows** and uses Windows-specific APIs (WinRT + Windows Graphics Capture). It will not work on macOS or Linux.

## Features

* Capture a specific application window by title
* Produce a numpy.ndarray
    dtype: np.uint8(0-255)
    shape: (height, width, 4)
    channels: RGBA
* Lightweight, dependency-minimal wrapper around WinRT/WGC functionality
* Works reliably across high-DPI displays and mixed-scaling setups
